# NotificationsPlus

This is a little quick and dirty program I threw together to improve the notifications I recieve through Outlook.

Doesn't do much other than just send more than one reminder for emails you have waiting and has multiple reminders for meetings that are starting soon.

Uses Windows notifications and gives detailed information on the email you have waiting in addition to the details about the upcoming meeting.
